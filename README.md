# A very basic React site with Webpack - Four

Add more code splitting, chunking, using `require` with React routes. Splitting with `require` while
building the routes allows for easy code splitting of modules that are loaded by the route when it's
navigated to. Added the `chunkFilename` option into the Webpack entry config to add simple, dynamic, number
based names for each chunk.
