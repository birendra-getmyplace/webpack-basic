# A very basic React site with Webpack

On this branch we add some `css` loading and break out our React code into
it's own `app.jsx` file.

We also bring the Material Design Lite assets into the `src` tree and bundle them into
our `main.js` instead of hardcoding them into `index.html`

And for a bit of demonstration, we add the `app.css` file to demonstrate the idea of a local or
module specific `css` file that is bundled and whom's changes will be reflected live
when using the development server.
